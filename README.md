## Course Overview


## Goals: 
- Learn about the complexity of climate, hydrology, and their interactions with the human environment. 
- Learn about the role of water resource engineers, data science, and environmental modeling in the environmental management. 
- Become comfortable with basic coding practices and concepts; be able to interpret, run, and write beginner-level Python code. 
- Gain familiarity with probability and statistics concepts, how they can be used in environmental studies, and how to use code to measure them.
- Complete a case study for a student-chosen location of interest, focused on the unique interactions between the hydrology and the human system.

## Internship Materials


### Presentations



### Coding Activities

Throughout the internship you will learn some basic coding skills, and run some code of your own. 

The code language we will be using in this internship is called [Python](https://www.python.org/). Python is one of the most popular coding languages in the world because it is free, relatively easy to read and write, and has a big community of people working together to make it better.

Code activities will be completed using [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) which helps users to run code online without requiring any installation or complicated set-up.

The four coding activities are available in the Aquatic Algorithms repository and are called:
- `Part0_intro_to_python.ipynb`
- `Part1_streamflow_analysis.ipynb`
- `Part2_intro_to_environmental_statistics.ipynb`
- `Part3_mapping_watershed.ipynb`

## Daily Schedule

| Date | Summary |
| ---- | ---- |
| 7/24 | Course overview and small tour. Introductory lecture on the water cycle, human influences, and "wicked problems" in environmental systems. I will also introduce the case study that students will perform over the duration of the internship.|
| 7/25 | Lecture review of central water resource planning and management challenges and how data science and modeling can help us make decisions. Second hour will include an introduction to Python activity (using Google Colab online) where they will learn the basics of coding in Python. Students should begin context-research for their case study (history, environmental and social challenges, existing infrastructure system, etc.)|
| 7/27 | Lecture on basic environmental probability and statistics. Students will access the US Geologic Survey Water Information System website and explore data sources near their case study. Second hour will include a Python coding exercise where students get historic streamflow data for their case study location, make nice plots of the data, and calculate some basic statistics.|
| 7/31 | Lecture and interactive demonstrations of different modeling techniques used in climate and hydrologic modeling.  Students will complete another coding exercise focused on measuring extreme-flow (drought/flood) events at the study location. Students should identify streamflow or other environmental variables relating to location-specific challenges.|
| 8/1  | Lecture on the potential future of water resource planning, including the integration of machine learning, big data, and emerging perspectives. The group will play [*The Intelligent Piece of Paper*](http://www.cs4fn.org/teachers/activities/intelligentpaper/intelligentpaper.pdf) and will lead into a discussion on human-computer interaction, limitations, and pitfalls. Students will complete the final interactive coding activity where a watershed map is created for their case study location. Any remaining time will be used for case study work. |
| 8/3  | A series of mini-presentations (3 x 10 minute) from different graduate students in the CEE department about their unique research topics. Time for students and mentor to discuss their case study progress and work on presentations prior to the STEP-UP symposium.|

## Case Study Overview

Over the course of the internship, the students will be tasked with preparing a poster-based case study of a unique water resource system.

### Objectives
1. Gain familiar with both the human and natural context for the case study of interest.
	1. Identify the critical water resource infrastructure in the region
	2. Identify the primary water resource challenges and objectives
	3. Access hydrologic data, study the natural hydrology, and identify drought and floods during the historic record (done through coding activities), 
2. Prepare a poster-presentation that helps to summarize the water resource planning challenges for the case study location. 
	1. Design data visualizations that help to describe the hydrologic characteristics of the region (done through coding activities)
	2. Draw connections between natural hydrologic processes and urban challenges in the past for this location. 
	3. Design a poster which emphasizes a unique narrative for the case study location (e.g., how a historic drought impacted the residents, how the populations are growing and stressing water supplies, how new infrastructure options may be needed in the future)

### End-of-Summer Presentation

Students will prepare a poster-presentation highlighting their case study at the end of the internship period. Currently, the STEP-UP program expects to host a **Sympoisum on August 16th, where students will share their results.** However this date is not finalized.
