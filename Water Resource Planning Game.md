## Overview
Congratulations, you have been elected Mayor!  You are now responsible for investing in your town's water resource infrastructure.

The objective is to make decisions that balance meeting water demand, avoiding bankruptcy, and managing environmental impacts while dealing with uncertain weather conditions.

## Game Components
- Dice: 2d6, 1d10, 2d5
- Budget 
- Scoreboard

## Setup
1. Each player starts as the Mayor of their own town; pick a name for your town!
2. All players begin with a budget of $1,000,000.

## Game Stages

### Stage 1: Initial Investment (15 minutes)
Players allocate their initial budget among the following infrastructure options:

1. Reservoir
   - Small ($300,000): Capacity 100 units
   - Medium ($500,000): Capacity 200 units
   - Large ($800,000): Capacity 300 units

2. Canals
   - Basic ($200,000): Redirects up to 50 units of flood water
   - Advanced ($400,000): Redirects up to 100 units of flood water

3. Temporary Storage
   - Small ($100,000): Capacity 50 units, lasts 5 rounds
   - Large ($200,000): Capacity 100 units, lasts 5 rounds
   - **Note:** This can be purchased any time, and will become usable during the next turn.

4. Forecasting Technology
   - Basic ($150,000): Provides next round's water inflow prediction
   - Advanced ($300,000): Provides next 3 rounds' water inflow predictions

### Stage 2: Gameplay Rounds
Each round consists of the following steps:

1. Weather Event Determination:
   - Roll 1d10
     - If 1: Drought begins
       - Roll 2d5: First die determines drought duration (1-5 rounds), second die determines drought severity
         - 1-2: Mild (70% of normal inflow)
         - 3-4: Severe (40% of normal inflow)
         - 5: Extreme (20% of normal inflow)
     - If 10: Flood occurs
       - Roll 1d5 to determine flood magnitude for the next round:
         - 1: 150% of normal inflow
         - 2: 200% of normal inflow
         - 3: 250% of normal inflow
         - 4: 300% of normal inflow
         - 5: 400% of normal inflow
     - 2-9: Normal weather

2. Water Inflow Determination:
   - Roll 1d6 x 10 for base inflow
   - Apply any active drought or flood multipliers

3. Water Demand Determination:
   - Roll 1d6 x 5 for base demand
	   - 1-3 = 4
	   - 4-6 = 6 
   - During droughts, increase demand by 20%

4. Player Decisions:
   a. Determine water release downstream
   b. Decide water delivery to town
   c. Allocate any excess water to reservoir or temporary storage

5. Outcome Calculations:
   - Unmet demand: -1 pt for each unmet demand unit
   - Reservoir overflow: - 100 if storage > 100% after any turn
   - Environmental impact: -1 pt for any flow below target

6. Financial Calculations:
   - Collect revenue: $10,000 per unit of water delivered
   - Pay operational costs: $50,000 per round

7. End of Round:
   - Update scoreboard
   - Advance drought/flood counters if active
   - Reduce lifespan of temporary storage if in use

### Stage 3: Mid-Game Upgrade (after Round 10)
Players can choose to upgrade their infrastructure, in each case just pay the cost of original skill - previous investments:
- Increase reservoir capacity
- Build new canals 
- Invest in new forecasting technology
- Construct new temporary storage (original cost, available every round)

### Stage 4: Climate Change Event (after Round 15)
- Increase frequency of extreme events: Drought occurs on 1-2, Flood occurs on 9-10 on 1d10 roll

### Stage 5: Final Assessment (after Round 20)
Calculate final scores based on:
- Remaining budget
- Points from meeting demand
- Points for avoiding overflow
- Environmental protection bonus: +50 points if environmental flow was maintained for all rounds


## Winning the Game
The player with the highest combined score of points and remaining budget (including infrastructure value) wins. In case of a tie, the player with the best environmental record wins.
